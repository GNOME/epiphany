- Check that filtering is not done more than one time on bookmarks dialogs init
- change font size pref name or convert if possible

Downloader:

- Update rate (used for estimated time) only after some time, otherwise estimated
keep to chang in an annoying way
- Fixup column sizing. Ideally filename should get all available space, the
others column can get the minimum (for progress we can just fixup requisition
in the renderer to something sane)
- Cleanup downloader-view, there is prolly still crap here and there
- Add LOGs on all objects involved in download. Init/Finalize and in c++
constructor/destructor. Verify that references are correct == objects
are destroyed at right time.
- Probably use cur from total instead of just total in the size field
- fix EphyHeaderSniffer style

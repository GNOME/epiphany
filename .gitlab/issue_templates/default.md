If you are encountering a problem with displaying web content, please report it directly to [WebKit Bugzilla, WebKitGTK component](https://bugs.webkit.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=WebKit&component=WebKitGTK) rather than here. This includes problems with loading or displaying websites, and problems with graphics, network, scrolling, video playback, or anything that you see in the web content view that's beneath Epiphany's tab bar. We will see your bug report on WebKit Bugzilla as long as the WebKitGTK component is selected.

This Epiphany issue tracker is the right place to report problems that are not related to web content. Please delete all of this text except for the following info to provide:

 * Epiphany version (from About Web in the main menu):
 * WebKitGTK version (from About Web -> Troubleshooting -> Debugging Information):
 * Distributor (Linux operating system, Flathub, Epiphany Tech Preview, etc.):

# Embedded PDF Viewer based on pdf.js

This directory contains an official pdf.js release version, distributed at: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js

## Update process
Grab a new official release (*-dist.zip) distributed at github and extract everything except viewer.html into this directory.
Then recreate the resource xml file with `python pdfjs-generate-resource.py`

The additional files within this directory are modified for Epiphany and shouldn't be changed.

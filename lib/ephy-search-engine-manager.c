 * returns the corresponding search URL as returned by ephy_search_engine_build_search_address().
 * The last word will be looked at first, so that when someone changes their
 * mind at the end of the line they can just type the new bang and it will
 * be used instead of the first one.
 *
 * What is called a "bang search" is a search of the form "!bang this is the
 * search query", or with the bang at the end or at both ends (in which case
 * the end bang will be preferred).
 *
 * Returns: (transfer full) (nullable): The search URL corresponding to @search, with
 *   the search engine picked using the bang available in @search, or %NULL if
 *   there wasn't any recognized bang engine in @search. As such this function can
 *   also be used as a way of detecting whether @search is a "bang search", to
 *   process the search using the default search engine in that case.

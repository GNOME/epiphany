==============

Changes:

  - *NOTE* this release removes support for traditional extensions (as

    will *not* work anymore, and won't be loaded on startup. See

  - Adblock is now imported into the core browser, disabled by
    default. See Preferences->Privacy to enable it (#681657)
  - Remove JavaScript preference from the UI. Pretty much every single
    page the average user visits needs JavaScript, so this is a
    "Please break my web" preference in disguise. For those concerned
    about security and/or privacy the GSetting remains
    available. (#685393)
  - Merge the application menu in the gear menu when not running under
    the Shell. (#673054)

  - Initial WebKit2 support!

    This is still in the early stages of development, but the basic
    functionality is already in place. It is under heavy development,
    and the goal is to deliver a Beta quality version for 3.6. You can
    follow the WebKit2 metabug:
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678610, and enable the
    WebKit2 port passing "--with-webkit2" to 'configure' (disabled by
    default).

  - Improve fullscreen UI, and add support for HTML5 fullscreen
    (#676905)
  - Add support for 'Do Not Track', http://donottrack.us/
  - Migrate profile directory to the XDG config directory
    (~/.gnome2/epiphany -> ~/.config/epiphany) (#522810)

Epiphany 3.3.91

    rewritten. It now uses SQLite as the storage medium, and can keep
    your browsing history indefinitely (so gone is the 10-day
    limit). This has been an heroic team effort by Martin Robinson,
    Claudio Saavedra and Xan López, so buy them a beer next time you
    see them.

    our extra methods/information that used to be in
    EphyEmbed. EphyEmbed is no longer an interface, just a wrapper
    that contains an EphyWebView and that properly sets it up. Since
    there aren't any more interface classes to be implemented by

===============
Epiphany 2.21.4
===============

A big refactoring of the Epiphany internals was done in order to achieve better
cross-engine support. It can be roughly separated in two chunks:

 - EphyTab and its usage of GtkMozEmbed specific signals was transformed
   into generic code under EphyBaseEmbed with backend-agnostic gobject-properties.
   Backends are now encouraged to subclass EphyBaseEmbed and update its
   properties to keep them in sync with the engine state. In turn, the browser
   chrome will connect to the notify:: signals for the properties to update its
   UI to reflect those changes.

-  In some situations the embed/ code will need to know some specific details of
   the fronted (for example, the active child among all the embed instances in the
   popup management code). Instead of directly accessing the fronted, an generic
   EphyEmbedContainer interface has been created, offering all the needed methods.
   In Epiphany, this interface is implemented by EphyWindow.

Bug fixes:
    * Add saved files to the GtkRecent list. Fixes Bug #148401.
    * Make cursor be at the end of the URL when selecting entries from the
	  completion popup. Fixes bug #466344.
    * Fix multihead problems in toolbar editor.
    * Fix download-icon toolip updates. Fixes bug #343238.
    * Default to Cancel on Cert dialogues. Fixes bug #163379.
    * Remove "Add bookmark" and "Save as" from the document context menu.
	  Part of bug #332968.
    * Fix completion model to show icons for history items too,
      history/bookmarks/favicon_cache service objects are now stored in the
      completion priv. Fixes bug #459811.
    * Sets page header and footer margins to a reasonable value when printing.
      Workaround for bug #346110.
    * Adds a check for NULL pointer in ephy-session.c, fixing wrong behaviour when
      restoring Epiphany in some cases. Fix for bug #488718.
    * Updates to new NetworkManager API signals for status monitoring.
    * Take the page orientation from the page setup, not from the print settings.
      Bug #485670 (see also gtk+ bug #485685).
    * Makes the Go button behaviour consistent with the "Enter" behaviour. Both
      actions search for keywords or load the url. Fixes #484178.
    * EphyContentPolicy::ShouldLoad: use the same content policy for
      http and https, allowing adblock to work on https. Fixes bug #471583.
    * Make Epiphany properly remember the last saved location in the FileChooser.
      Fix for bug #336251.
    * Make session recovery focus work properly and remember the active tab.
      Fixes bug #317272.
    * Fix disable_toolbar_editing lockdown not respected for Remove and Move
      actions on toolbar buttons. Fixes bug #475641.
    * Change the hint of the bookmarking properties dialog to DIALOG, instead
      of NORMAL. Make bookmarking work in fullscreen mode and does not put
      bookmark properties windows in the taskbar. Fixes bug #478928.
	* Find toolbar now remembers last pattern searched also when opened with
      slash or apostrophe. Fixes bug #343337.

      popup of the location entry when using a dark theme (like Darkilouche).
      Fixes bug #446898.

	* Make "Up" button dropdown menu show titles instead of URLs for already
	  visited pages. Fix for bug #323764.
	* Remove ellipsis from View -> Page Security Information, as it does not
	  require further user interaction to complete. Fix for bug #483312.
	* Hide Back/Forward buttons when disable_history lockdown key is enabled.
	  Fixes bug #394795.
	* Add explanation label to "Only from sites you visit" radio button.
	  Fixes bug 493422.
	
Changes: 
    * Add accessibility theme icons for our apps icon.
	* Enable printing to PDF file on gecko 1.9, now that moz#367907 is
	  fixed.
	* Make 'Not found' on find toolbar temporarily bold and sounds the 
	  bell signal when searching on a page and no results are
	  found. Fixes bug #363004.
	* Makes tooltips for Back and Forward buttons display the titles of
      relative pages. Fixes bug #341400. 
	* Add drag-and-drop of URLs onto "New Tab" and "New Window" buttons in
      the toolbar. Fixes bug #382383.
	* Add a broom icon in the search entry of the History window,
	  like in Bookmarks Editor. Fixes bug #476179.
	* Use friendly display for mailto: links; shows a nice text in status bar
      when hovering a mailto: link. Fixes bug #339161.
	* Fix the build of the custom GTK+ filepicker. Add a preview for the 
	  FileChooser. The default size is 150x150. Fixes bug #440859.
    * Make the location entry completion cells smarter, now bookmarks take the 
	  full width of the popup. Also make titles of history entries align
      to the left so it's easier to browse a lot of entries with similar 
	  titles. Almost-fixes bug #419475.
	* Change the "Powered by" name in the About dialog according to the used
      backend. Fix for bug #478196.
	* Display "Execute script <title>" string as tooltip for bookmark action
	  instead of the whole javascript code when bookmarking a scriptlet.
      Fix bug #492695.
	* Update to latest EggToolbarEditor code.
      This supports changing the editor's model during runtime and
      tries to avoid some possibly leaking signal handlers. 
	  Fixes bug #493149.
	* Adds a column in the history window showing the date and the time of the
      visit, substitutes radiobuttons with checkboxes in the View menu of the 
	  window. Fix bug #380156.
	* Enable a --with-distributor-name configure option, defaulting to Epiphany.
      Use it on an error page to designate the distributors/developers to
	  contact. Fixes bug #433796.
	* Add a "Remove all" button to the Personal Data Manager for both the
	  cookies and the passwords. Addresses bug #148314.
	* Fix a bug in EphyNodeView which caused problems when setting columns
	  as resizable; thanks to Kristian Rietveld for finding out the cause.
	  Make history window columns resizable and bookmarks editor columns
	  resizable and sortable. Fixes bug #132808.

===============
Epiphany 2.19.6
===============

The most important change in this release is obviously that an experimental 
WebKit back-end was added by Xan Lopez. Read all about it here:
http://blogs.gnome.org/xan/2007/07/17/epiphany-webkit/

Furthermore, we have been joined by Cosimo Cecchi who contributed a lot of
small but not less important gnome-love bugfixes! 

Changes: 
	* Add support for the WebKit engine, compile with --with-engine=webkit
          to activate
	* #162489: Added a checkbox for smooth scrolling. 
	* String changes based on user feedback:
	  - "Local sites" -> "Nearby sites" (because it is a
	  better description)
	  - Drop the "Quick" prefix from Topic/Bookmark items in
	  toolbar editor, because it has no function besides
	  confusing users.
	* We now use g_get_user_special_dir to get the Desktop and Downloads
	  directory location
	* Use the new gtk functions to persist and load the print settings and
	  page setup. Migrate our old settings, if present.
	* All tooltips are now creatd using the new GTK tooltips API.

Bug fixes:
	* #459552: Improve the restricted ports message 
	* #448610: Make the status icon clickable so it shows/hides 
	  the download window, works across workspaces
	* #318947: Update tab title when the statusbar text is updated, 
	  so we don't have out of sync messages 
	  (like "Loading <page-you-were-before>")
	* Misc: #461689, #433173, #313636, #410223, #385872, #452707, #347637,
	  #450904

===============
Epiphany 2.19.5
===============

For those who are wondering: Epiphany 2.19.3 and 2.19.4 were never released. 

Changes:
	* Copy the lock icons from g-i-t 2.16 into epiphany, since the new ones
          in g-i-t are broken (see bug #348350 comment 93 ff).
	* Sync with latest libegg toolbareditor
	* use "document-page-setup" named icon for STOCK_PRINT_SETUP (now 
          available on gnome-icon-theme trunk)

Bug fixes:

	* #452769: Use GTK_STOCK_ABOUT icon instead of GNOME_STOCK_ABOUT
	* #450590: Add a workaround to take into account that Gtk{Radio,Toggle}Actions
                   only set either the stock-id or the icon-name property depending on
                   the image type. This makes it possible to display the icon of such
                   actions in the toolbar editor.
	* #450146: Use g_option_group_set_translation_domain to
                   translate commandline options.

==============

Changes:
	* Add certificate manager. Patch by Robert Marcano and Crispin
	  Flowerday. Fixes bug #119090.
	* Fix crash when adding a cookie while the dialogue is open.
	* Also check for GDK_ISO_Enter.
	* Close the find toolbar when loading a new page.
	* Forward up/down/page up/page down from the findbar entry to the
	  embed.
	* Fix a compile warning, and don't bother requesting a close if the
	  find bar is already closed
	* Updated comment to refer to the schema autogeneration tool.
	* Remove the paper selector from the print setup dialogue, we have
	  one in the print dialogue already.
	* Fix spacings to be HIG compliant. Set window roles.
	* Add image/x-png type to list of safe mime types.
	* Use --with-gecko in the distcheck configure args.
	* While in find mode, set the selection colour to "attention".
	* Refactor find toolbar closing not to crash with auto-closing
	  popups. Unset the selection colour on close.
	* Open the PDM dialogue on the cookies page scrolled to show the
	  cookies of the currently loaded page, if there are any. Sort
	  cookies by domain. Allow treeview typeaheadfind search to find
	  by substring not prefix.
	* Add chrome: and resource: to the safe list; otherwise forms
	  and scrollbars break. Fixes bug #316498.
	* Delay reloads when we get many change notifications in a short
	  time. Fixes bug #319993.
	* Add F5 as accelerator for reload.

	  delay when opening the PDM dialogue when you have many cookies.

	  bug #321590.

	* Mark message for translation. Patch by Guilherme de S. Pastore,
	  fixes bug #319988.
	* Transition over to the Galeon mechanism for handling extra
	  keybindings. This maps the keybindings to actions so that no extra
	  actions are required. The only subtlety is that some of the
	  actions come from the toolbar, so access to its action group is
	  required.

Changes

		* Make Mozilla paper sizes work with gnome-print [#163255].

		  around mozilla bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=292699
		* Don't focus the checkbox initially. Fixes [#163371].
		* If the search term is empty for a smart bookmark use the normal URL
		  instead of the smart url with the %s replaced by ""
		* Don't use "cat >" as output command, it fails inpredicably.
		  If not using gecko 1.9, translate the paper name to the one
		  mozilla expects (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=307404).
		* Use the tab label's outer hbox for the size calculation instead of
		  the label itself. Fixes size oscillations with the Tab States
		  extension.

		  Fixes [#314974].
		* Don't spin unmapped spinners. Slightly decrease the frequency.
